> Apache-2.0 on the code, CC BY 4.0 on around 1,100 brief footers, and CC0 1.0 on the published articles — which no document in the corpus mentions or reconciles. The licensing of the estate, stated, with the open question left open.

# Three licences, three layers, and one nobody had noticed

Anyone can hold a position on open source. Showing the licence file is different — and building this page turned up an inconsistency in the estate's own licensing that no document anywhere in the corpus mentions. A site *about* open-source licensing carrying an unexplained mismatch would be caught, so it is stated here first.

## What is actually in force

| Layer | Licence | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Code** — the application repositories and the Issues-FS estate | **Apache-2.0** | `LICENSE` files, and `license = "Apache 2.0"` in every `pyproject.toml` |
| **Briefs and corpus documents** | **CC BY 4.0** | A footer on roughly 1,100+ files: *"This document is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)."* |
| **Published articles** — `docs.diniscruz.ai` | **CC0 1.0 Universal** — public domain | The repository's `LICENSE` file |

> **The third row is the finding.** The briefs treat CC BY 4.0 as the estate-wide answer — it is *rule two* of the corpus discipline, applied to every document. The published-articles repository is actually **public domain**. **No document anywhere in the corpus mentions CC0 or reconciles it with the CC BY rule.** Nobody had noticed.

## Two readings, and which one this site takes

It is either a deliberate maximal-openness choice worth explaining, or drift to be corrected. **It cannot be neither**, and the reasoning is interesting either way.

|  | Reading A — deliberate layering | Reading B — drift |
|---|---|---|
| **The claim** | Each layer got the licence its *function* needs: Apache-2.0 for code, where a patent grant matters; CC BY for the working corpus, where attribution carries provenance; CC0 for finished essays, where the goal is maximum reach and attribution is friction. | Three repositories were set up at three different times by one person, each with a sensible default, and nobody ever compared them. |
| **What supports it** | It is genuinely coherent, and the estate does think in layers. There is real logic to a published essay being public domain while a working brief carries attribution: **the essay is meant to travel; the brief is meant to be traceable.** | The corpus's total silence. A deliberate three-layer licensing strategy is exactly the sort of thing this corpus writes down — **and it wrote nothing.** Rule two says CC BY, without exception or carve-out. |
| **What it would take to confirm** | One sentence from the author saying it was intended. | The same sentence, saying it was not. |

> **This site's position: unresolved, and flagged as a decision the author has to make.** Reading A is available and defensible, and this page will not claim it retrospectively on the author's behalf — inventing an intention after the fact is exactly the kind of tidying this site exists to argue against. **It is logged as an open question** on [the roadmap](../roadmap/index.md#open) and as an ask on [the comms board](../admin/comms.md). What is *not* ambiguous is this site's own content, which is CC BY 4.0 throughout and stamped in CI.

## The CC BY reasoning, which *is* documented

Four distinct arguments exist for the CC BY choice, and they are worth separating because they are not the same argument:

**Alignment, not compliance.***"The Creative Commons licence aligns with our zero-lock-in principle. We are already committed to zero lock-in and open standards. A project released entirely under CC BY 4.0, using open source tools, with no proprietary components — this is the natural extension of our existing values."*

**It is a hard rule, not a preference.** Rule two of the corpus discipline is a licence footer at the bottom of every document, and every day-index brief closes with it. That is what produced 1,100+ consistent footers — **a rule, mechanically applied**, which is why the CC0 divergence stands out as much as it does.

**BY versus BY-SA was actively considered, and BY won.** The question is recorded — *"CC BY-SA 4.0 or CC BY 4.0 for the licence? BY-SA encourages derivatives to stay open; BY is more permissive"* — and permissive was chosen. That is a real decision, and it sits interestingly against [the survivability argument](../survivability/index.md), which is in effect the claim that **licences are the weakest of the structural protections**. If you believe that, choosing the more permissive licence costs you less than it appears to, because you were never relying on the licence to do the work.

**Openness is a credibility asset, and it is backed.***"The transparency claim is credible because it is **backed** (the CC BY 4.0 corpus, the public briefs, rendering from a public vault)."*

## Downstream licences are respected

*"CC BY 4.0 for the article and most contents; original source materials retain their own licences."* In practice that means Wardley-map briefs carry a bespoke footer crediting Simon Wardley's own Creative Commons terms — a small discipline, and a good illustration of the general rule: **your licence governs your contribution, not the material you built on.**

This site applies the same rule and states it explicitly, because it quotes the open-source world at length: Wikipedia material is CC BY-SA and is quoted with attribution rather than adapted; project documentation and vendor reports are cited with source, date and caveat rather than reproduced; [charts from all-rights-reserved analyst reports are never reproduced at all](../history/numbers.md).

## The line: everything open, except at the customer

> "The line is very simple: **everything is open source**, so you do not even have that conversation. It is a key pillar. It is not for everybody, some investors will not like it, but you find the ones who do, and it is a good match. You can always commercial-license or relicense everything for a customer who wants it, but the core is all open source. **No part of the company or the ecosystem is not open source.**"

Note the mechanism hidden in the middle of that: *"you can always commercial-license or relicense everything for a customer who wants it."* That is only possible **because a single company holds the copyright** — which is [exactly the structure that fails leg one of our own stress test](../survivability/self-audit.md). The flexibility and the exposure are the same fact viewed from two sides, and it is worth being clear that they cannot be separated.

And the commercial hook is explicitly not the code: *"We do not have that lock-in on technology, and that is fundamental. The natural line is a business line, and that is okay: that is when you charge to maintain it. It is the hook, but a hook based on value… The customer's schemas can be closed, a lot of their data is closed, **but our schemas are open**."*

Whether the customer subset makes this open core rather than packaging is [a separate page with a one-question test](../views/open-core.md).

## What has actually been published

| Package or estate | Where | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **`sgit-ai`** | PyPI · `SGit-AI/SGit-AI__CLI` | Named that way because *"`sgit` was already taken"*. CI: push to main → tests → deploy to qa → PyPI publish. |
| `sg-send-cli` | PyPI | **Deprecated 20 March 2026**, superseded by `sgit-ai`. |
| **`issues-fs`** and six siblings | `owasp-sbot` | All Apache-2.0. [The org choice is itself a thread →](../owasp/index.md) |
| **The `osbot-*` / `mgraph-*` family** | PyPI · `owasp-sbot` | Described internally as *"2 years of open source infrastructure"*. **`MGraph-DB` is publicly credited to the OWASP community.** |

> **And the gap underneath all of it.** There is **no document anywhere explaining why any of these was open-sourced**, what the licence decision was for each, or what happened afterwards. Six real published projects and not one retrospective — with one honourable exception, the O2 Platform article, which is written *about* the author rather than by him.

### [Why Apache-2.0 rather than MIT](apache-vs-mit.md)

*Written fresh*

The most conspicuous unwritten page in the whole brief: the entire estate rests on that choice and the reasoning existed nowhere.

### [Publish the source next to the render](publish-the-source.md)

*A mechanism*

The markdown twin at every URL, how it was actually built, and the radical version nobody has shipped: publish the evidence and every prompt.
