> SGraph's copyright is held by one company: the exact single-holder pattern our own survivability argument identifies as the failure mode. The four legs run on ourselves, what would have to change, and whether we intend to change it.

# We run the test on ourselves, and we fail leg one

A tool whose author will not apply it to themselves is a marketing asset. One who does is a standard. So here is [the Change-of-Control Stress Test](stress-test.md) run against this project's own estate, with the same four legs, the same evidence rules, and no softening on the leg we fail.

> **The short version.****SGraph's copyright is held by one company.** That is precisely the single-holder pattern the [survivability argument](index.md#mechanism) identifies as the mechanism behind every catalogued relicensing between 2018 and 2024. If you apply our own test to us, leg one fails — and it fails for the same structural reason it failed for the projects we cite.

## The four legs

| Leg | Result | The evidence, and what it means |
|---|---|---|
| **1 · Copyright structure** | Fails | Copyright is held by **a single company**. There is no distributed-copyright structure and no DCO regime with independent contributors behind it — which is partly a consequence of [the position that open source is right even with zero contributions](../views/index.md#zero-contributions). That position is coherent, and this is its structural cost: a project with no external contributors has, by construction, no distributed copyright. **One party could ship the next release under different terms.** Nothing structural prevents it. |
| **2 · Trademark holder** | Fails | Held by the operating company, transferable with the company. There is no neutral foundation and no charter-level restriction on transfer. A fork could take the code and could not take the name — the same asymmetry the test asks you to check for in anyone else. |
| **3 · Schema licence** | Partial | The stated position is unambiguous — *"The customer's schemas can be closed, a lot of their data is closed, **but our schemas are open**"* — and [the argument that schemas matter as much as code is ours](../views/sovereignty.md#step2). What is missing is the artefact: the schemas are not **separately licensed** with their own declared terms in the way leg three asks for. The intent passes; the paperwork does not yet exist. This is the cheapest of the three to fix and it is not fixed. |
| **4 · Fork capacity** | Fails | There is no named party with the headcount and mandate to run a fork. Honestly: there is no community to be the unnamed party either, so this is not even the *"the community would fork it"* answer the test flags as failing — it is the answer below that one. The code is Apache-2.0 and genuinely forkable; **nobody is standing by to fork it**. |

> **Verdict, by our own tool: single-party dependent.** Three fails and a partial. This is the pattern every relicensing in the 2018–2024 wave followed. It does not mean this project will be relicensed. It means **nothing structural would stop it**, and that an acquisition would carry the standing along with the company — which is exactly what we say about everyone else, and it is exactly as true here.

## Why publish this

Three reasons, in order of how much they matter.

**Because the test would be worthless otherwise.** The whole proposition of a four-leg test answerable from public artefacts is that it does not depend on the assessor's goodwill. An assessor who exempts themselves has demonstrated that the test is a marketing instrument dressed as a diagnostic, and every reader is right to discount it accordingly.

**Because it is the same discipline the corpus already applies elsewhere.** The estate's own listed tension about publishing security reviews reads: *"It is unusually transparent and **it publishes your own weaknesses to an audience that includes people looking for them**."* That cost is real. It is also the reason the transparency claim is worth anything at all.

**Because the honest answer to "will you fix it?" may be no** — and that is still publishable, and still more useful than silence.

## What would have to change, and whether we intend to

| Leg | What fixing it actually requires | Position |
|---|---|---|
| **1 · Copyright** | Either move copyright to a neutral entity, or adopt a DCO with inbound=outbound and accumulate enough independent contribution that no single party retains standing. The first is a legal step available now; the second cannot be done unilaterally and is **years of other people's work**. | **Not resolved.** A single-founder company with no external contributors cannot distribute copyright by deciding to. Moving it to a foundation is possible and has costs — governance, control, the ability to relicense for a customer, which is [an existing commercial mechanism](../views/open-core.md). **No decision has been taken, and pretending one has would be worse than saying so.** |
| **2 · Trademark** | Transfer to a neutral holder, or publish a trademark policy that states what a fork may and may not call itself. | **Not done.** The second half — **publishing a policy** — costs almost nothing and removes the worst of the ambiguity even while the holder stays the same. It is the clearest unforced gap on this page. |
| **3 · Schemas** | Declare the schemas under their own licence (CC0 or CC BY), separately from the code, in the repositories that define them. | **Should be done, and is the cheapest.** The position is already stated; the artefact is missing. It is on [the build order](../roadmap/index.md), and there is no good argument for its not being done. |
| **4 · Fork capacity** | A named third party with engineers and a mandate. | **Not in our gift**, and worth being blunt about: **this leg is not fixable by the project it is about**. It is a fact about the world outside the project. Any vendor claiming to pass leg four on its own say-so should be treated with suspicion — including us. |

## What this does not concede

Failing the test is not a confession that the model is wrong; it is the model working. The four legs describe **exposure**, and the exposure described here is real, priced, and now public. What a reader should take from it:

- The code is **Apache-2.0 and already published**. The licence you have cannot be withdrawn — [that is what the licence file genuinely guarantees](index.md#mechanism), and it is not nothing.
- What is not guaranteed is the terms of the *next* release, and no assurance from us changes that. **Structure is what changes it**, and the structure is what fails.
- Every argument on this site about the risk of single-holder projects **applies to this one**. Readers should discount accordingly, and the discount is the honest price of the argument.

> **Where this is still weaker than it should be.** This page audits *structure*. It does not yet publish an SBOM of the estate, a licence-scan result, or an upstream-contribution record — all of which the site argues companies should publish. [That gap is stated on the missing page](../shipped/index.md#supply-chain), where it belongs, rather than quietly omitted from here.
